# Title: Frontend Deployment Platform
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: 1, 5, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up frontend deployment platform with automated deployments and preview environments.

Configure Vercel or Netlify for frontend deployment with the following requirements:
- Automatic deployments from main branch to production
- Preview deployments for all pull requests with unique URLs

- Custom domain configuration (if applicable)
- Branch-based deployment rules (main -> production, other branches -> preview)
- Integration with GitHub repository for automated triggers
- Deployment status reporting back to GitHub PRs

# Test Strategy:
Create a test PR to verify preview deployment functionality. Test production deployment by merging to main branch. Verify environment variables are correctly applied in different deployment contexts. Check build performance and optimization settings. Test custom domain configuration if applicable. Verify deployment status updates appear correctly in GitHub PR interface. Test rollback functionality by reverting a deployment.

# Acceptance Criteria:
- Frontend application deploys automatically on push to main
- Preview deployments are created for every PR
- Build process completes without errors
- Environment variables are correctly configured
- Deployment URLs are accessible and functional
- GitHub integration shows deployment status
