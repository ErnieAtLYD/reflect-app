# Task ID: 2
# Title: Design System and UI Component Library
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish a design system with reusable UI components focusing on accessibility and responsive design.
# Details:
Create a design system using Tailwind CSS for utility classes. Define a color palette with high contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text) to ensure accessibility. Implement responsive breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop views. Create reusable components: Button, TextArea, Card, LoadingSpinner, ErrorMessage, and Feedback (thumbs up/down). Ensure all components are keyboard navigable and screen reader friendly by implementing proper ARIA attributes. Use the @headlessui/react library (v1.7.17) for accessible UI components like dialogs and toggles. Implement dark/light mode support using Tailwind's dark mode feature.

# Test Strategy:
Test components in isolation using React Testing Library. Verify accessibility using axe-core or similar tools. Test responsive behavior using different viewport sizes. Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements. Test with screen readers like NVDA or VoiceOver.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Accessible Color Palette and Typography [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish a color palette with high contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text) and set up typography scales to ensure readability and accessibility across the design system.
### Details:
Configure Tailwind CSS theme settings to include custom color variables and font families. Use tools like the WebAIM contrast checker to validate color combinations. Document the palette and typography guidelines for consistent usage.

## 2. Implement Responsive Design Foundations [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Configure Tailwind CSS responsive breakpoints and global layout utilities to support mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
### Details:
Set up breakpoints in tailwind.config.js according to the app's requirements. Define container, spacing, and grid utilities for flexible layouts. Document responsive design patterns for component usage.

## 3. Develop Core Reusable UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Build the Button, TextArea, Card, LoadingSpinner, ErrorMessage, and Feedback (thumbs up/down) components using Tailwind CSS and @headlessui/react for accessible primitives.
### Details:
Implement each component as a functional React component, applying Tailwind utility classes for styling. Use @headlessui/react for dialogs and toggles where needed. Ensure components are modular and support props for customization.

## 4. Integrate Accessibility Features and ARIA Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Ensure all components are keyboard navigable and screen reader friendly by implementing proper ARIA attributes and focus management.
### Details:
Add ARIA roles, labels, and states to interactive components. Use semantic HTML elements where possible. Test keyboard navigation and focus order. Leverage @headlessui/react for accessible dialogs and toggles.

## 5. Implement and Document Dark/Light Mode Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.3
### Description: Enable dark and light mode theming using Tailwind's dark mode feature and ensure all components adapt visually and remain accessible in both modes.
### Details:
Configure Tailwind's dark mode in the config file. Apply conditional classes to components for color and background changes. Document usage and provide examples for toggling modes.

## 6. Configure Custom Breakpoints for Reflect App [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up custom responsive breakpoints in Tailwind CSS v4 tailored to the Reflect app's specific requirements for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
### Details:
Define custom --breakpoint-* variables in globals.css using the @theme directive. Configure breakpoints for xs (480px), sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px), and 2xl (1536px) to support the app's responsive design needs.

## 7. Define Container and Layout Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create container utilities and layout helpers for flexible, responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS v4's theme system.
### Details:
Define --container-* variables for different screen sizes (xs: 20rem, sm: 24rem, md: 28rem, lg: 32rem, xl: 36rem, 2xl: 42rem). Add spacing utilities and grid system configurations for flexible layouts. Ensure utilities work seamlessly with the custom breakpoint system.

## 8. Create Responsive Design Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document responsive design patterns, component usage guidelines, and best practices for the Reflect app development team.
### Details:
Create comprehensive documentation covering: breakpoint system usage, mobile-first design approach, container query patterns, component responsiveness examples, touch-friendly interaction guidelines, and testing strategies for different screen sizes.

## 9. Test and Validate Responsive Behavior [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Thoroughly test responsive layouts and components across all breakpoints to ensure smooth adaptation without overflow or layout issues.
### Details:
Use browser dev tools to test layouts at all defined breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl). Verify content adapts smoothly, check for overflow issues, test touch interactions on mobile devices, and validate container query behavior. Document any issues and create fixes.
