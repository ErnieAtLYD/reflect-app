# Task ID: 14
# Title: Accessibility Implementation
# Status: complete
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure the application is fully accessible to users with disabilities.
# Details:
Implement proper semantic HTML throughout the application. Add ARIA attributes where necessary for complex components. Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements. Implement focus management for modals and dynamic content. Test and fix color contrast issues using the WCAG 2.1 AA standard (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text). Add skip links for keyboard users. Ensure all form elements have associated labels. Make sure error messages are announced by screen readers. Test with screen readers like NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver. Implement reduced motion options for users with vestibular disorders.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct an accessibility audit using axe-core or similar tools. Test keyboard navigation throughout the app. Verify screen reader announcements for dynamic content and errors. Check color contrast using tools like Contrast Checker. Test with actual screen readers on different browsers. Verify that all interactive elements have visible focus states. Test with users who rely on assistive technology if possible.
