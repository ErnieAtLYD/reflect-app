# Task ID: 16C
# Title: Environment Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up environment-based configuration for development, staging, and production environments.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive environment management with the following features:
- Development environment configuration with hot reloading and debugging tools
- Staging environment that mirrors production for testing
- Production environment with optimized settings and security configurations
- Environment variable management for API keys, database URLs, and feature flags
- Environment-specific build configurations and optimizations
- Logging levels and monitoring configurations per environment
- Feature flag system for gradual rollouts and A/B testing
- Database connection strings and migration strategies per environment
- API endpoint configurations for different environments
- Environment validation to ensure all required variables are present

# Test Strategy:
Deploy application to each environment and verify correct configuration loading. Test environment variable isolation between environments. Verify feature flags work correctly in different environments. Test database connections and migrations in staging environment. Check logging levels and output in each environment. Verify API endpoints resolve correctly per environment. Test environment validation catches missing required variables. Confirm production optimizations are applied correctly.

# Acceptance Criteria:
- All three environments (dev/staging/prod) are properly configured
- Environment variables are correctly isolated and secure
- Feature flag system allows controlled rollouts
- Database connections work correctly in each environment
- Logging and monitoring configurations are environment-appropriate
- Environment validation prevents deployments with missing config
- Staging environment accurately reflects production setup
