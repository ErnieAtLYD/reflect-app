# Task ID: 16F
# Title: Infrastructure & SSL
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure domain management, SSL certificates, and database infrastructure for production deployment.
# Details:
Set up production infrastructure with the following components:
- Custom domain configuration with proper DNS settings
- SSL certificate management with automatic renewal (Let's Encrypt or similar)
- CDN configuration for optimal content delivery and performance
- Database setup and migration strategy for production data
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures for critical data
- Load balancer configuration if required for high availability
- Security headers and CSP (Content Security Policy) configuration
- HTTPS redirect enforcement and HSTS implementation
- Database connection pooling and optimization for production load
- Automated database migration pipeline with rollback capabilities
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) setup using Terraform or similar
- Health check endpoints for monitoring and load balancer configuration
- Rollback procedures for both application and database changes

# Test Strategy:
Verify custom domain resolves correctly with SSL certificate. Test SSL certificate automatic renewal process. Check CDN performance improvements and cache behavior. Test database migrations run successfully in production-like environment. Verify backup and restore procedures work correctly. Test rollback procedures for both application and database. Check security headers are properly configured. Test health check endpoints respond correctly. Verify HTTPS redirects and HSTS policy enforcement. Test database connection pooling under simulated load.

# Acceptance Criteria:
- Custom domain is properly configured and accessible via HTTPS
- SSL certificates are automatically managed and renewed
- Database migrations work reliably with rollback capability
- Security headers and CSP are properly configured
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures are tested and documented
- Health check endpoints are functional for monitoring
- Infrastructure can handle expected production load
- All infrastructure is documented and reproducible
