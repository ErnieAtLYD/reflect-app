# Task ID: 16
# Title: Deployment and CI/CD Pipeline (Parent Task)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up continuous integration, deployment, and monitoring for the application.
# Details:
This task has been broken down into focused subtasks for better management and parallel execution:

- Task 16A: Frontend Deployment Platform (Vercel/Netlify setup with preview deployments)
- Task 16B: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (GitHub Actions workflows and automation)  
- Task 16C: Environment Configuration (Dev/staging/production environments)
- Task 16D: Monitoring & Error Tracking (Sentry implementation)
- Task 16E: Security & Code Scanning (Snyk and automated security checks)
- Task 16F: Infrastructure & SSL (Domain, SSL certificates, database migrations)

Each subtask maintains the original dependencies (1, 5, 7) and high priority. The task is complete when all subtasks are finished.

# Test Strategy:
Integration testing across all subtasks to ensure the complete deployment pipeline works end-to-end. This includes testing deployments, monitoring alerts, security scans, and environment configurations working together.
