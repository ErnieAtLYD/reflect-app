# Task ID: 16
# Title: Deployment and CI/CD Pipeline (Parent Task)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up continuous integration, deployment, and monitoring for the application.
# Details:
This task has been broken down into focused subtasks for better management and parallel execution:

- Task 16A: Frontend Deployment Platform (Vercel/Netlify setup with preview deployments)
- Task 16B: CI/CD Pipeline Setup (GitHub Actions workflows and automation)  
- Task 16C: Environment Configuration (Dev/staging/production environments)
- Task 16D: Monitoring & Error Tracking (Sentry implementation) **[STRETCH GOAL]**
- Task 16E: Security & Code Scanning (Snyk and automated security checks) **[STRETCH GOAL]**
- Task 16F: Infrastructure & SSL (Domain, SSL certificates, database migrations) **[STRETCH GOAL]**

Core subtasks (16A, 16B, 16C) maintain the original dependencies (1, 5, 7) and high priority. Stretch goal subtasks (16D, 16E, 16F) are optional enhancements. The task is complete when core subtasks (16A-16C) are finished.

# Test Strategy:
Integration testing across all subtasks to ensure the complete deployment pipeline works end-to-end. This includes testing deployments, monitoring alerts, security scans, and environment configurations working together.
