Configure Vercel or Netlify for frontend deployment with preview deployments for PRs. Set up serverless functions deployment for the backend API. Implement environment-based configuration for development, staging, and production. Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment. Set up monitoring and alerting using Sentry for error tracking. Implement automated security scanning in the CI pipeline using tools like Snyk. Configure domain and SSL certificates. Set up a staging environment for testing before production deployment. Implement automated database migrations if using a database for feedback collection.

# Test Strategy:
Test the CI/CD pipeline by making changes and verifying they deploy correctly. Verify that preview deployments work for pull requests. Test the monitoring system by triggering test errors. Check that environment variables are correctly applied in different environments. Verify SSL configuration and security headers. Test the rollback process in case of deployment failures. Verify that the staging environment accurately reflects production.
