# Task ID: 13
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the application for fast load times and responsive user experience.
# Details:
Implement code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense to reduce initial bundle size. Add a service worker for caching static assets using Workbox (v7.0.0). Optimize images and assets using next/image or similar tools. Implement lazy loading for non-critical components. Use React.memo and useMemo/useCallback hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Set up proper caching headers for static assets. Implement prefetching for likely user paths. Optimize the critical rendering path by inlining critical CSS. Use Lighthouse and WebPageTest to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.

# Test Strategy:
Measure performance metrics using Lighthouse before and after optimizations. Test load times on various devices and network conditions. Verify that code splitting works by checking network requests. Test service worker functionality for offline access to static assets. Measure Time to Interactive and First Contentful Paint. Check bundle size and ensure it remains under 200KB for initial load. Verify that lazy loading works correctly for non-critical components.
