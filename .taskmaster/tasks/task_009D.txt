# Task ID: 9D
# Title: One-Time Feedback Prevention System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9A, 9B, 9C
# Priority: medium
# Parent Task: 9 - User Feedback Collection System
# Description: Implement system to prevent duplicate feedback submissions per reflection.

# Details:
Create a duplicate prevention mechanism that tracks submitted feedback per reflection ID. Implement client-side tracking using localStorage/sessionStorage to mark when feedback has been submitted for a reflection. Update the feedback component to disable submission buttons after feedback is given. Implement visual feedback states (submitted, disabled) for better UX. Add database queries to check for existing feedback before accepting new submissions based solely on reflection ID (since each reflection should only receive one feedback). Handle edge cases like page refreshes, multiple tabs, and session clearing. Provide clear user messaging when duplicate submission is prevented.

# Client-Side Implementation:
- Track submitted feedback in localStorage with reflection ID as key
- Disable feedback buttons immediately after submission
- Persist feedback state across page reloads
- Clear old feedback tracking data after 24 hours

# Server-Side Implementation:
- Query database for existing feedback with same reflection_id only
- Return appropriate error for duplicate submissions
- Log duplicate attempts for monitoring

# UX Considerations:
- Show "Feedback submitted" state with checkmark
- Disable buttons with appropriate visual styling
- Provide clear messaging: "Thank you for your feedback!"
- Handle edge cases gracefully with user-friendly messages

# Database Queries:
```sql
-- Check for existing feedback
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM feedback 
WHERE reflection_id = ?;
```

# Test Strategy:
Test that feedback can only be submitted once per reflection. Verify client-side state persists across page reloads. Test server-side duplicate prevention with same reflection ID. Verify proper error messages for duplicate attempts. Verify feedback state cleanup after time period. Test behavior with multiple browser tabs open.
