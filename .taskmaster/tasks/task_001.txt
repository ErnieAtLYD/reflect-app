# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Repository Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with React, set up the development environment, and configure essential tools and dependencies.
# Details:
Create a new React project using Create React App or Next.js (recommended for better SEO and performance). Next.js 14.0.2 is the latest stable version with App Router support. Set up ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript for code quality. Configure the project structure with folders for components, hooks, utils, and styles. Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment to Vercel. Initialize package.json with required dependencies including React 18, TypeScript 5.0+, and Tailwind CSS 3.3+ for styling. Create a .gitignore file to exclude node_modules, build artifacts, and environment files.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the development server starts without errors. Ensure ESLint and TypeScript configurations work correctly by running linting commands. Test the CI/CD pipeline by making a small change and confirming it deploys correctly to the staging environment.
