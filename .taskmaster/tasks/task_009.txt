# Task ID: 9
# Title: User Feedback Collection System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the thumbs up/down feedback system for reflections with anonymous data collection.
# Details:
Create a feedback component with thumbs up and thumbs down buttons. Implement a serverless function endpoint to collect feedback data. Generate a random reflection ID for each feedback submission to maintain anonymity. Store only the feedback value (positive/negative) and optional non-identifying metadata like browser type or device category. Add a brief privacy note explaining that feedback is anonymous. Implement a one-time feedback rule per reflection to prevent duplicate submissions. Create a simple dashboard or logging system to view aggregate feedback metrics. Use a database like Supabase (PostgreSQL) or Firebase Firestore for storing feedback data.

# Test Strategy:
Test the feedback submission process. Verify that no identifying information is sent with feedback. Test the one-time feedback rule. Check that the feedback endpoint correctly records submissions. Verify the privacy note is displayed. Test the aggregate metrics display. Verify that feedback can be submitted without any user account or identification.
