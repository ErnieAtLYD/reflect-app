# Task ID: 16D
# Title: Monitoring & Error Tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive monitoring and error tracking using Sentry and performance monitoring tools.
# Details:
Set up robust monitoring and error tracking system with the following components:
- Sentry integration for real-time error tracking and reporting
- Performance monitoring for frontend load times and API response times
- User session replay for debugging complex user interactions
- Custom error boundaries for React components with proper error reporting
- API endpoint monitoring and alerting for downtime or slow responses
- Database query monitoring and optimization alerts
- Real-time alerting for critical errors via email/Slack/PagerDuty
- Error aggregation and trend analysis dashboards
- Source map uploads for precise error location tracking
- User feedback collection system integrated with error reports
- Custom performance metrics for key user actions (journal entry submission, AI processing)

# Test Strategy:
Trigger test errors to verify Sentry captures and reports correctly. Test performance monitoring by simulating slow operations. Verify error boundaries catch and report component errors properly. Test alerting system with various error scenarios. Check source maps provide accurate error locations. Test user feedback integration with error reports. Verify custom performance metrics are tracked correctly. Test session replay functionality captures user interactions. Confirm database monitoring alerts work as expected.

# Acceptance Criteria:
- Sentry captures all frontend and backend errors
- Performance monitoring tracks key metrics accurately
- Error alerts are sent promptly to the team
- Source maps enable precise error location identification
- Error boundaries prevent application crashes
- Custom metrics track journal entry and AI processing performance
- Dashboard provides actionable insights for system health
- Integration works seamlessly across all environments
