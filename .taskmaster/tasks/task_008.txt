# Task ID: 8
# Title: LocalStorage Implementation for History
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement optional local storage functionality to save recent entries and reflections.
# Details:
Create a toggle component for enabling/disabling local history storage. Implement LocalStorage service to save and retrieve journal entries and reflections. Limit storage to last N entries (e.g., 5-10) to prevent excessive local storage usage. Encrypt stored data using a library like crypto-js (v4.1.1) for additional privacy. Implement a clear history function that removes all stored entries. Create a history view component to display saved entries and reflections. Add timestamps to entries for chronological display. Ensure the LocalStorage toggle state itself is remembered between sessions.

# Test Strategy:
Test saving and retrieving entries from LocalStorage. Verify the toggle functionality enables and disables storage correctly. Test the clear history function. Check that the limit of N entries is respected. Verify that entries are properly encrypted when stored. Test the history view with various numbers of saved entries. Verify the toggle state is preserved between sessions.
