# Task ID: 16E
# Title: Security & Code Scanning **[STRETCH GOAL]**
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: [STRETCH GOAL] Implement automated security scanning and code quality checks using Snyk and other security tools.
# Details:
Set up comprehensive security scanning and code quality pipeline with the following tools:
- Snyk integration for dependency vulnerability scanning and remediation suggestions
- Static application security testing (SAST) for code vulnerability detection
- Secret scanning to prevent accidental commit of API keys and credentials
- License compliance checking for all dependencies
- Docker image security scanning for containerized deployments
- GitHub Security Advisories integration for automatic security updates
- Code quality analysis with SonarCloud or similar tools
- Automated dependency updates with security patch prioritization
- Security headers validation for production deployments
- OWASP Top 10 compliance checking
- Regular penetration testing automation where applicable
- Security policy enforcement in CI/CD pipeline with failure gates

# Test Strategy:
Introduce test vulnerabilities to verify scanning detects them correctly. Test secret scanning by attempting to commit fake credentials. Verify dependency vulnerability alerts trigger correctly. Test automated security patch suggestions and updates. Check security headers are properly configured in production. Test CI pipeline blocks deployments with critical security issues. Verify license compliance reports are accurate. Test integration with GitHub Security Advisories. Confirm OWASP compliance checks pass for the application.

# Acceptance Criteria:
- All dependencies are scanned for known vulnerabilities
- Secret scanning prevents credential commits
- CI pipeline blocks deployments with critical security issues
- Automated security updates are suggested and tested
- Production deployment has proper security headers
- License compliance is maintained across all dependencies
- Security scanning integrates seamlessly with GitHub workflow
- Regular security reports are generated and actionable
