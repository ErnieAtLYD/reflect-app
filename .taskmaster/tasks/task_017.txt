# Task ID: 17
# Title: Documentation and Onboarding
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5, 7, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
# Details:
Create a user guide explaining how to use the application. Write developer documentation for the codebase including architecture overview, component structure, and API documentation. Document the AI prompt design and parameters. Create a README.md with setup instructions, available scripts, and contribution guidelines. Add inline code comments for complex logic. Document environment variables and configuration options. Create a changelog to track version updates. Add a FAQ section addressing common questions and privacy concerns. Document known limitations and edge cases.

# Test Strategy:
Review documentation for clarity and completeness. Have someone unfamiliar with the project attempt to set it up using only the documentation. Verify that all API endpoints and components are documented. Check that environment variable requirements are clearly specified. Ensure the user guide covers all features and common questions.
