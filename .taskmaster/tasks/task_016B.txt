# Task ID: 16B
# Title: CI/CD Pipeline Setup
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: 1, 5, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing, building, and deployment.
# Details:
Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions with the following workflows:
- Pull Request workflow: Run tests, linting, type checking, and build verification
- Main branch workflow: Run full test suite, build, and trigger deployment
- Automated dependency updates with security checks
- Code quality gates that prevent merging failing PRs
- Parallel job execution for faster feedback
- Caching strategies for node_modules and build artifacts
- Environment-specific deployment triggers
- Notification system for build failures
- Integration with deployment platform (Vercel/Netlify)
- Automated testing of e2e scenarios in CI environment

# Test Strategy:
Create test PRs to verify all CI checks run correctly. Test main branch deployment workflow. Verify that failing tests prevent deployment. Test caching effectiveness by comparing build times. Check that environment variables are correctly passed to CI jobs. Test parallel job execution and dependencies. Verify notification system works for failures. Test integration with deployment platform. Ensure e2e tests run reliably in CI environment.

# Acceptance Criteria:
- All PRs trigger automated testing and quality checks
- Main branch deployments only occur after passing all tests
- Build cache reduces CI execution time significantly
- Failed tests prevent deployment progression
- CI status is clearly visible in GitHub PR interface
- E2e tests run successfully in CI environment
- Deployment integration works seamlessly
