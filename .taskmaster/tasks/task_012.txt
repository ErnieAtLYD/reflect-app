# Task ID: 12
# Title: Error Handling and Resilience
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application for a smooth user experience.
# Details:
Create user-friendly error messages for different error scenarios. Implement error boundaries in React to prevent the entire app from crashing. Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls with exponential backoff. Implement offline detection and appropriate messaging. Create fallback UI components to display when primary components fail. Log errors to a monitoring service like Sentry (v7.80.0) for debugging without capturing PII. Handle edge cases like very long inputs, unusual characters, or potential XSS attacks. Implement timeout handling for AI requests that take too long.

# Test Strategy:
Test various error scenarios by forcing API failures. Verify that error boundaries catch component errors without crashing the app. Test retry mechanisms by simulating intermittent failures. Check offline behavior by disabling network connectivity. Verify that error logs don't contain PII. Test with extreme inputs to ensure proper handling. Verify timeout handling by simulating slow responses.
