# Task ID: 5
# Title: AI Integration Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the backend service to handle AI processing of journal entries using OpenAI's API.
# Details:
Create a serverless function using Vercel Serverless Functions or AWS Lambda. Implement secure API integration with OpenAI using their Node.js SDK (v4.17.4). Use the GPT-4 Turbo model (gpt-4-1106-preview) for best quality or GPT-3.5 Turbo (gpt-3.5-turbo-1106) for cost efficiency. Design a prompt template that instructs the AI to generate: 1) A brief summary (1-2 sentences), 2) A detected pattern or theme, and 3) A gentle, actionable prompt or suggestion. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse. Set up error handling for API failures, timeouts, and content policy violations. Create environment variables for API keys and configuration. Implement caching strategies to reduce API costs for repeated or similar entries.

# Test Strategy:
Test the API integration with various journal entry samples. Verify that the AI responses match the expected format. Test error handling by simulating API failures and timeouts. Measure response times to ensure they meet the target (<3 seconds). Test rate limiting by sending multiple requests in quick succession. Verify that sensitive API keys are not exposed to the client.
