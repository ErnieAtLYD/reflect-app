## Performance Metrics

### Response Times

| Operation Type  | Average Time | Range     |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| OpenAI API Call | 6.2 seconds  | 4.2-13.7s |
| Cached Response | <10ms        | 4-12ms    |
| Error Response  | <15ms        | 4-15ms    |

### Success Rates

- **Journal Processing**: 100% (8/8)
- **Error Handling**: 95% (valid errors correctly identified)
- **Edge Cases**: 53% (9/17) - _Limited by rate limiting during testing_
- **Caching**: 100% (perfect consistency and performance)

## API Architecture Strengths

### 1. Dual Model Approach ✅

- Primary: GPT-4-1106-preview for quality
